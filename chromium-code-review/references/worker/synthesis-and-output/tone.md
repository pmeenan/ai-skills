# Synthesis And Output

This file is executed by the late-phase worker agents: the
Reconciliation-Builder, the Draft-Writer, and the Synthesis Challenger. The
severity section also binds verification skeptics, whose CONFIRMED verdicts
must name an anchor from the table below. The orchestrator does not load
this file. Artifact shapes live in `references/templates.md`; the
contradiction checklist and Gerrit output rules live in
`references/verification-and-fixes.md`.

## Tone

Follow Chromium review norms: assume competence and goodwill, lead with concrete
findings, explain why each requested change matters, ask "why" when intent is
unclear and affects correctness, label optional polish as optional, and make
landing blockers explicit.
