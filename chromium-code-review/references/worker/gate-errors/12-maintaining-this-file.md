# Gate-error lookup table

**Rule this file enforces: never read or grep a helper script's source to work
out what a gate rejection meant.** Look the message up here. If the message you
hit is missing, adding it to this file is part of the fix — the next run must
not have to re-read the script either.

**Do not read this file end to end — query it.** At over 700 rows it is a
database, and reading it would simply relocate the cost it exists to remove:

```sh
<skill-dir>/scripts/explain-gate-error.py "<the message you saw>"
```

Paste the message verbatim, including paths and line numbers; the lookup
ignores them and matches the parameterized form below. Exit 1 means no row
matched, and adding one is then part of the fix.

By hand, if you must: take the distinctive substring of the failure (usually
the part after `ERROR: ` or `<script>.py: ERROR: `), find it in the table for
the script that produced it, and apply the **Fix** verbatim. The trailing **Source** column
names the file and line so a maintainer can re-verify a row; you do not need to
open it to act on the row.

`validate-review-dir.py` prints every finding as `ERROR: <message>` or
`WARNING: <message>` and ends with `FAIL: <n> error(s), <m> warning(s)` or
`PASS: 0 errors, <m> warning(s)`. Warnings never fail the gate. Every other
script prints `<script-name>: ERROR: <message>` on stderr and exits 1.

## 12. Maintaining this file

When you hit a gate message that is not in this table:

1. Fix the underlying problem.
2. Add a row here, in the section for the producing script, with the real
   message substring, what it meant, the imperative fix, and the
   `<file>:<line>` you found it at.
3. If you could not find the message in any script, record its source as
   `observed in run logs, not located in source` rather than inventing a line
   number.

Line numbers drift. If a cited line no longer contains the quoted message,
re-locate it and update the **Source** cell rather than deleting the row.
